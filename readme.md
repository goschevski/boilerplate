# Fronty
Fronty is a boilerplate for starting new front-end projects.

### Why boilerplate?
I explained my opinion on this topic in blog post "[Thoughts on CSS Frameworks](http://goschevski.com/thoughts-on-css-frameworks/)".

### Dependencies
Fronty is using gulp to compile css (postcss), javascript (browserify) and to optimize images.
```
$ npm i
$ gulp watch
```
